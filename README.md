# üè´ School Management System (Cloud-First Edition)

## ‚ú® About This Project

This is a full-featured School Management System built with modern web technologies ‚Äî Vue.js, Express.js, and Sequelize ORM. The project was initially envisioned as a **desktop-first application** using Electron, but evolved into a **cloud-first solution** with the goal of eventually supporting web, Android, and desktop interfaces from a **single shared codebase**.

> üí¨ "I started this journey building a local desktop app because many schools in my area lack reliable internet, and a local-first tool seemed perfect. But as I developed the architecture, it became clear that a **modular, API-first approach** would let me serve both online and offline use cases. So I‚Äôve now pivoted to make this project **cloud-native**, without losing the ability to package it for desktop later."

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why I'm Building This

> "I've worked with schools where paper records still dominate. Admins struggle with Excel sheets, fees are tracked manually, and there's no transparency. I wanted to build a system that's not just another bloated SaaS product, but one that's lean, **educator-focused**, and works **even when the internet is flaky**. This is that system."
